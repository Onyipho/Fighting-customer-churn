# Fighting-customer-churn
This is an ongoing project based on proposed framework for combating customer shown. We Implement part of the framework that involves predicting customer shown using artificial neural networks and a tool for analysing customer sentiments using Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner(VADER) in python. Next, weâ€™ll incorporate sentiment analysis into the customer dataset and factor in customer review sentiments to predict better customer churn probabilities.
